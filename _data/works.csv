F,the view from here,chamber,2016,"flute, clarinet, horn, percussion, violin, viola, and cello",9,Emlyn Johnson,Music in the American Wild,the-view-from-here,,,Y,"<p>For this work, I collaborated with my close friend, former neighbor, and wonderful poet F. Daniel Rzicznek, who teaches English composition and poetry at Bowling Green State University. After telling him about the project, I asked him to write a poem that I could respond to in some way, and Compass is the result.</p><p>The images within Compass immediately called to mind Shenandoah National Park, a park special to me and one not far from my home in Richmond, Virginia. Each of the three movements in the view from here bears a title that comes from a line of Dan's poem and also contains a subtitle connecting it to Shenandoah.</p><p>The first movement, ""drones and swells of the not-far road,"" is a meditation on the park's most prominent feature: Skyline Drive, a scenic highway winding its way through the entire park. ""a point off in the blue woods,"" the second movement, was inspired by Big Meadows (a large, open space in the heart of the park) and features bells and distant, fragmented quotes of the folk song ""O Shenandoah."" The third movement ""moving points in the hooves and feet of animals"" is subtitled ""hawksbill"" for the trail leading to the highest summit of the park, which offers incredible vistas and many opportunities for encountering wildlife.</p>"

,Recast Fragments,chamber electroacoustic,2015,"clarinet, violin, cello, piano, and electroacoustic music",9,Ensemble U:,Third Practice Electroacoustic Music Festival,recast-fragments,,,Y,"Recasting is the process of giving new form to an object by melting it down and reshaping it. This metaphor captures the way in which I approached composing the four movements of <em>Recast Fragments</em>. In the first and third movements, the musical material has been rearranged and reworked with respect to instrumental register, orchestration, timbre, and the electronics. The second and fourth movements share the same harmonic framework and sense of atmosphere but the details of the musical surface have been significantly transformed."

F,Smoke and Mirrors,chamber electroacoustic,2013,"flute, clarinet, violin, cello, percussion, piano, and electroacoustic music",8,,ASCAP/SEAMUS Student Commissioning Program,smoke-and-mirrors,,smoke-and-mirrors,Y,"Most of my electroacoustic music involving live performers takes advantage of the potential for perceptual ambiguity between acoustic and electroacoustic domains. Each domain engages in a sort of cross-pollination with the other, where ideas from the acoustic world appear in the electronics and vice versa, resulting in an overall integrated gestalt. In Smoke and Mirrors, I took this approach again with the guiding concept of considering the ensemble and electronics as two components of an object or image capable of gradually coming into and out of focus. Smoke and Mirrors was commissioned as part of the 2012 ASCAP/SEAMUS Student Commissioning Program and has been released on CD the Music from SEAMUS Volume 23."
F,deep in liquid indigo,chamber,2012,"flute, clarinet, percussion, harp, piano, violin, viola, and cello",9,Ensemble Interface,,deep-in-liquid-indigo,,deep-in-liquid-indigo,Y,"I decided on the title of this work after I had completed the music, as I tend to do, and this one in particular comes from the first line of an early poem by Sylvia Plath called Aquatic Nocturne. Much of Plath's poetry is dark and psychologically intense, but what attracted me to this early poem was its rich atmosphere, vivid imagery, and strong sense of flow. In this work and several of my others, I approach form in a very fluid and malleable way. The attack of a chord or isolated note can initiate a ripple, and the shape of single gesture can act as a source, generating streams and tributaries of different energies. The transformation of these musical gestures and textures throughout the piece imparts a quality of ebbing and flowing tension reminiscent of ocean tides. While it was not my intent to reflect on Plath's poem in a programmatic sense, both my piece and her poem share common thematic imagery. deep in liquid indigo was premiered at the 2012 June in Buffalo summer music festival in Buffalo, NY by the German new music group Ensemble Interface."

To complete my immersion experience, I read some French poetry and found the title of this piece in the Victor Hugo poem â€œLa Tombe Dit Ã€ La Rose.â€ The work captures the atmosphere of the poem and also refers to the way in which the electronics relate to the pianist- often shadowing or following the performer but occasionally asserting itself with quick dynamic interjections."

My intention was not to set this poem in a programmatic sense, but rather I sought to explore and respond to its rich atmosphere and vivid imagery. "

In <em>Doppelgänger</em>, for percussion and live electronics, this idea of doubling is explored in the electroacoustic component, which shadows the percussionist by reinterpreting and recontextualizing the acoustic material. The percussionist alternates between structured and improvisatory sections creating a flexible environment that allows a dialogue between acoustic and electroacoustic worlds."

Conscious and unconscious, good and evil, rational and irrational. The tension created by the presence of opposites and the process of acknowledging both, he argued, was necessary to create any sort of forward momentum and resolution that would ultimately lead to personal growth and individuation. <em>The Spark of Opposites</em> is an exploration and embodiment of this process. It was commissioned by and is dedicated to my great friend and very talented composer/performer Heather Stebbins."

The piece exploits the resonance that is left after a sharp attack. The gradual harmonic and timbral unfolding of this resonance heard in the opening creates a slowly evolving and quiet musical landscape that encourages introspection."
