I received an honorable mention in the 2010 <a href="http://www.michiganmusicteachers.org/commissionedComposers.php">Michigan Music Teachers Association Composer Commissioning Program</a>! The winners were Eric Guinivan from USC, who received first prize, and Steve Snowden from UT Austin, who received second prize.
