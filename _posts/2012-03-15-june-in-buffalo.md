In addition to Fontainebleau, I will be attending the new music festival and conference [*June in Buffalo*](https://music21c.buffalo.edu/june-in-buffalo/) where I will be writing a new work for flute, clarinet, harp, piano, percussion, violin, viola, and cello to be premiered by [Ensemble Interface](http://www.ensembleinterface.com/en/).
