The Switch~ Ensemble performed on Ossia's fall December 2nd concert in Eastman's Kilbourn Hall. We performed Karlheinz Stockhausen's 1967 work *Mikrophonie I* for tamtam, 2 microphones, 2 filters, and controllers.

> In *Mikrophonie I* two percussionists play a large tam-tam with a variety of implements. Another pair of players use hand-held microphones to amplify subtle details and noises, inflecting the sound through quick (and precisely scored) motions. The last two performers, seated in the audience, apply resonant bandpass filters to the microphone outputs and distribute the resulting sounds to a quadraphonic speaker system. (Burns 2002, 63)

*Performers:*  
Megan Arns & Connor Stevens, percussionists  
Andrea Venet & Drew Worden, microphonists  
Jason Thorpe Buchanan & Christopher Chandler, sound projectionists
