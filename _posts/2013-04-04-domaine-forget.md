This summer I will be attending a new music workshop and festival in Qu√©bec called [*Domaine Forget*](http://www.domaineforget.com). Soon I will be getting started on a new work for large ensemble which will be workshopped and premiered at the festival by [Le Nouvel Ensemble Moderne](http://www.lenem.ca). I am really looking forward to having the opportunity to working with them and conductor Lorraine Vaillancourt.
