I am thrilled to be joining the University of Richmond faculty for the 2014-15 academic year as a Visiting Instructor. I will be teaching courses in music technology and composition, private composition lessons, as well as directing the Third Practice Electroacoustic Music Festival. It is a wonderful turn of events to be returning to my alma mater to work alongside wonderful colleagues and help put on the festival that I've been involved with since 2005. Looking forward to the coming year!
