I am very pleased to announce the release of *Music from SEAMUS Volume 23*. The CD contains a recording of [*Smoke and Mirrors*]({{site.baseurl}}/music/smoke-and-mirrors.html) performed by the inimitable Switch~ Ensemble. We recorded the piece last fall at Eastman. Thanks to Jason Thorpe Buchanan for his conducting and Clay Mettens for his assistance with setup and engineering.
