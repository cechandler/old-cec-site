The Estonian group [Ensemble U](http://uuu.ee/index_en.html) is this year's featured guest ensemble at the Third Practice Electroacoustic Music Festival. 3P is celebrating its 15-year anniversary with four commissions by University of Richmond alumni, including new works by me and [Heather Stebbins](http://heatherstebbins.com/) for Ensemble U: and new works by [Matt McCabe](http://www.euph0r1a.net/) and [Jenny Bernard Merkowitz](http://faculty.otterbein.edu/jmerkowitz/Site/Home.html) for guest clarinetist [Andrea Cheeseman](http://music.appstate.edu/faculty-staff/dr-andrea-cheeseman).

Ensemble U premiered *Recast Fragments* in a concert on 11/3/15 at St. Cloud State University in St. Cloud, MN, and they will be giving another performance at Third Practice on 11/6/15.
