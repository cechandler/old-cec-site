I have just returned from a great week at the SEAMUS National Conference held in Lawrence University. I'm happy to say that I was awarded Second Prize in the ASCAP/SEAMUS Student Commission Competition! Congratulations to the First Prize recipient, [Eli Fieldsteel](http://www.elifieldsteel.com/), and the other finalists [Erik DeLuca](http://erikdeluca.com/) and [Lanier Sammons](http://www.laniersammons.com/Main/). As part of the award, ASCAP/SEAMUS has commissioned me to write a new work for the 2013 conference at McNally Smith College of Music in St. Paul, Minnesota.
