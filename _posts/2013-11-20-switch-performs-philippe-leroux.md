The Switch~ Ensemble performed on the Eastman Computer Music Center's fall concert on November 20th in Hatch Recital Hall. In addition to my [*Smoke and Mirrors*]({{site.baseurl}}/music/smoke-and-mirrors.html), we also performed the music of Philippe Leroux, including his incredible *Voi(rex)* for sextet and electronics.
