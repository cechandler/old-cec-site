A chamber orchestra version of my Master's thesis *Shifts* will be performed on the Cleveland Chamber Symphony's Young and Emerging Composer's Concert. The ensemble will be conducted by Steven Smith, and the concert will take place at 7:30pm on May 9, 2011 in Glick Recital Hall at the Music School Settlement in Cleveland, OH.
