Just returned from a great trip to NYC for some performances with Switch~ at the New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival. We played [*Smoke and Mirrors*]({{site.baseurl}}/music/smoke-and-mirrors.html) and Jason Thorpe Buchanan's *Asymptotic Flux: First Study in Entropy* on the opening concert of the festival.
